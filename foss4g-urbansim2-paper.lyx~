UrbanSim is an open source software package used to forecast the future
 locations of households and businesses in a regional economy in order to
 predict demand for public infrastructure including electricity, water,
 and greenspace, but in most practical planning applications UrbanSim’s
 raison d’etre is to allocate agents in a city to predict demand for transportat
ion infrastructure.
 An accurate assessment of the spatial distribution of households and businesses
 must be known in order to predict travel between people and their jobs
 and other non-work destinations (e.g.
 shopping, restaurants, and social trips) and when current transportation
 infrastructure will reach capacity and new roads, transit lines, and ped-
 and bike- infrastructure will need to be built.
 In recent years, these models are increasingly used to understand how to
 reach sustainability goals, including reducing water usage, land consumption,
 and how to substitute sustainable modes like transit, walking, and biking
 for increasing automobile use.

UrbanSim has existed for 15 years with the most cited publication having
 been published in 2002 (cite) and the travel demand forecasting models
 UrbanSim is designed to interoperate with were proposed almost 40 years
 ago (cite).
 Since its creation UrbanSim has been used in the official planning process
 for X number of Metropolitan Planning Organizations which are used to allocate
 billions of dollars in regional investments in transportation infrastructure
 on a yearly basis.
 UrbanSim is the most most frequently used land use modeling platform (cite)
 although other tools include Pecas (cite), and...

Interestingly, as UrbanSim grew over the past two decades to be a robust
 and community-supported open source software platform, it was nonetheless
 first written in the early days of the Python programming language.
 Python itself was introduced by Guido van Rossum in 1991 but began to gain
 popularity in practice in the late 90s.
 Another key Python library - the vector and matrix manipulation library
 NumPy - was first released in 2006, and is used heavily in econometric
 estimation for discrete choice models in the first UrbanSim implementation.
 Most recently, the Pandas library was released in 2010, and parallels between
 Pandas and the original UrbanSim dataset class and expression language
 first described in Borning et al (cite) are pervasive.

In other words, UrbanSim was a large domain-specific application trying
 to solve at least a few of the problems that were eventually taken up by
 the scientific community as a whole.
 The authors of the original UrbanSim realized this at the time and tried
 to expand the scope of the project by creating the Open Platform for Urban
 Simulation (cite) in 2005, but adoption rates were modest and the more
 general solution to the problem did not arrive until Pandas in 2010.
 UrbanSim has thus now become both of an historical artifact of the progress
 made in both the field of urban modeling, as well as an excellent case
 study for the power of leveraging the work of the scientific programming
 community to a domain-specific application, rather then

 in each application.

This paper will outline this argument, first by giving a brief history of
 urban modeling, followed by a discussion of the theory and implementation
 needs of UrbanSim, a case study of the implementation efficiencies gained
 between the two versions of UrbanSim, a more general description of the
 current open source scientific community, and closing with a discussion
 of future work in the area.
